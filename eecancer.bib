Here, we focus on alternate mechanisms-those without mutations, such as phenotypic plasticity and stochastic cell-to-cell variability that can also evade drug attacks by giving rise to drug-tolerant persisters. The phenomenon of persistence has been well-studied in bacteria and has also recently garnered attention in cancer. We draw a parallel between bacterial persistence and resistance against androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer (PCa), the primary standard care for metastatic disease. We illustrate how phenotypic plasticity and consequent mutation-independent or non-genetic heterogeneity possibly driven by protein conformational dynamics can stochastically give rise to androgen independence in PCa, and suggest that dynamic phenotypic plasticity should be considered in devising therapeutic dosing strategies designed to treat and manage PCa.},

	abstract = {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program has emerged as a central driver of tumor malignancy. Moreover, the recently uncovered link between passage through an EMT and acquisition of stem-like properties indicates that activation of the EMT programs serves as a major mechanism for generating cancer stem cells (CSCs); that is, a subpopulation of cancer cells that are responsible for initiating and propagating the disease. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting the widespread involvement of the EMT program in tumor pathogenesis and attempt to rationalize the connection between the EMT program and acquisition of stem cell traits. We propose that epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity is likely controlled by multiple varients of the core EMT program, and foresee the need to resolve the various programs and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them.},

	abstract = {Current investigation of cancer progression towards increasing malignancy focuses on the molecular pathways that produce the various cancerous traits of cells. Their acquisition is explained by the somatic mutation theory: tumor progression is the result of a neo-Darwinian evolution in the tissue. Herein cells are the units of selection. Random genetic mutations permanently affecting these pathways create malignant cell phenotypes that are selected for in the disturbed tissue. However, could it be that the capacity of the genome and its gene regulatory network to generate the vast diversity of cell types during development, i.e., to produce inheritable phenotypic changes without mutations, is harnessed by tumorigenesis to propel a directional change towards malignancy? Here we take an encompassing perspective, transcending the orthodoxy of molecular carcinogenesis and review mechanisms of somatic evolution beyond the Neo-Darwinian scheme. We discuss the central concept of " cancer attractors" - the hidden stable states of gene regulatory networks normally not occupied by cells. Noise-induced transitions into such attractors provide a source for randomness (chance) and regulatory constraints (necessity) in the acquisition of novel expression profiles that can be inherited across cell divisions, and hence, can be selected for. But attractors can also be reached in response to environmental signals - thus offering the possibility for inheriting acquired traits that can also be selected for. Therefore, we face the possibility of non-genetic (mutation-independent) equivalents to both Darwinian and Lamarckian evolution which may jointly explain the arrow of change pointing toward increasing malignancy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The development of drug resistance, the prime cause of failure in cancer therapy, is commonly explained by the selection of resistant mutant cancer cells. However, dynamic non-genetic heterogeneity of clonal cell populations continuously produces metastable phenotypic variants (persisters), some of which represent stem-like states that confer resistance. Even without genetic mutations, Darwinian selection can expand these resistant variants, which would explain the invariably rapid emergence of stem-like resistant cells. Here, by using quantitative measurements and modelling, we show that appearance of multidrug resistance in HL60 leukemic cells following treatment with vincristine is not explained by Darwinian selection but by Lamarckian induction. Single-cell longitudinal monitoring confirms the induction of multidrug resistance in individual cells. Associated transcriptome changes indicate a lasting stress response consistent with a drug-induced switch between high-dimensional cancer attractors. Resistance induction correlates with Wnt pathway upregulation and is suppressed by $\beta$-catenin knockdown, revealing a new opportunity for early therapeutic intervention against the development of drug resistance.},

We used genome-wide transcriptomics and single-cell phenotyping to explore the response kinetics to BRAF inhibition for a panel of patient-derived BRAFV600 -mutant melanoma cell lines. A subset of plastic cell lines, which followed a trajectory covering multiple known cell state transitions, provided models for more detailed biophysical investigations. Markov modeling revealed that the cell state transitions were reversible and mediated by both Lamarckian induction and nongenetic Darwinian selection of drug-tolerant states. Single-cell functional proteomics revealed activation of certain signaling networks shortly after BRAF inhibition, and before the appearance of drug-resistant phenotypes. Drug targeting those networks, in combination with BRAF inhibition, halted the adaptive transition and led to prolonged growth inhibition in multiple patient-derived cell lines.},

@article{Jia2017,
	abstract = {Waddington's epigenetic landscape, a famous metaphor in developmental biology, depicts how a stem cell progresses from an undifferentiated phenotype to a differentiated one. The concept of “landscape” in the context of dynamical systems theory represents a high-dimensional space, in which each cell phenotype is considered as an “attractor” that is determined by interactions between multiple molecular players, and is buffered against environmental fluctuations. In addition, biological noise is thought to play an important role during these cell-fate decisions and in fact controls transitions between different phenotypes. Here, we discuss the phenotypic transitions in cancer from a dynamical systems perspective and invoke the concept of “cancer attractors”—hidden stable states of the underlying regulatory network that are not occupied by normal cells. Phenotypic transitions in cancer occur at varying levels depending on the context. Using epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stem-like properties, metabolic reprogramming and the emergence of therapy resistance as examples, we illustrate how phenotypic plasticity in cancer cells enables them to acquire hybrid phenotypes (such as hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal and hybrid metabolic phenotypes) that tend to be more aggressive and notoriously resilient to therapies such as chemotherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy. Furthermore, we highlight multiple factors that may give rise to phenotypic plasticity in cancer cells, such as (a) multi-stability or oscillatory behaviors governed by underlying regulatory networks involved in cell-fate decisions in cancer cells, and (b) network rewiring due to conformational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that are highly enriched in cancer cells. We conclude by discussing why a therapeutic approach that promotes “recanalization”, i.e., the exit from “cancer attractors” and re-entry into “normal attractors”, is more likely to succeed rather than a conventional approach that targets individual molecules/pathways.},

Here we find that Paneth cells, a key constituent of the mammalian intestinal stem-cell (ISC) niche, augment stem-cell function in response to calorie restriction. Calorie restriction acts by reducing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling in Paneth cells, and the ISC-enhancing effects of calorie restriction can be mimicked by rapamycin. Calorie intake regulates mTORC1 in Paneth cells, but not ISCs, and forced activation of mTORC1 in Paneth cells during calorie restriction abolishes the ISC-augmenting effects of the niche. Finally, increased expression of bone stromal antigen 1 (Bst1) in Paneth cells—an ectoenzyme that produces the paracrine factor cyclic ADP ribose—mediates the effects of calorie restriction and rapamycin on ISC function. Our findings establish that mTORC1 non-cell-autonomously regulates stem-cell self-renewal, and highlight a significant role of the mammalian intestinal niche in coupling stem-cell function to organismal physiology.},

Here we show that high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity augments the numbers and function of Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells of the mammalian intestine. Mechanistically, a HFD induces a robust peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-$\delta$) signature in intestinal stem cells and progenitor cells (non-intestinal stem cells), and pharmacological activation of PPAR-$\delta$ recapitulates the effects of a HFD on these cells. Like a HFD, ex vivo treatment of intestinal organoid cultures with fatty acid constituents of the HFD enhances the self-renewal potential of these organoid bodies in a PPAR-$\delta$-dependent manner. Notably, HFD- and agonist-activated PPAR-$\delta$ signalling endow organoid-initiating capacity to progenitors, and enforced PPAR-$\delta$ signalling permits these progenitors to form in vivo tumours after loss of the tumour suppressor Apc. These findings highlight how diet-modulated PPAR-$\delta$ activation alters not only the function of intestinal stem and progenitor cells, but also their capacity to initiate tumours.},

@article{Kim2014a,
	abstract = {Cells differentiate when transcription factors bind accessible cis-regulatory elements to establish specific gene expression programs. In differentiating embryonic stem cells, chromatin at lineage-restricted genes becomes sequentially accessible, probably by means of 'pioneer' transcription factor activity, but tissues may use other strategies in vivo. Lateral inhibition is a pervasive process in which one cell forces a different identity on its neighbours, and it is unclear how chromatin in equipotent progenitors undergoing lateral inhibition quickly enables distinct, transiently reversible cell fates. Here we report the chromatin and transcriptional underpinnings of differentiation in mouse small intestine crypts, where notch signalling mediates lateral inhibition to assign progenitor cells into absorptive or secretory lineages. Transcript profiles in isolated LGR5(+) intestinal stem cells and secretory and absorptive progenitors indicated that each cell population was distinct and the progenitors specified. Nevertheless, secretory and absorptive progenitors showed comparable levels of H3K4me2 and H3K27ac histone marks and DNase I hypersensitivity--signifying accessible, permissive chromatin-at most of the same cis-elements. Enhancers acting uniquely in progenitors were well demarcated in LGR5(+) intestinal stem cells, revealing early priming of chromatin for divergent transcriptional programs, and retained active marks well after lineages were specified. On this chromatin background, ATOH1, a secretory-specific transcription factor, controls lateral inhibition through delta-like notch ligand genes and also drives the expression of numerous secretory lineage genes. Depletion of ATOH1 from specified secretory cells converted them into functional enterocytes, indicating prolonged responsiveness of marked enhancers to the presence or absence of a key transcription factor. Thus, lateral inhibition and intestinal crypt lineage plasticity involve interaction of a lineage-restricted transcription factor with broadly permissive chromatin established in multipotent stem cells.},

Yet many stem cells can divide symmetrically, particularly when they are expanding in number during development or after injury. Thus, asymmetric division is not necessary for stem-cell identity but rather is a tool that stem cells can use to maintain appropriate numbers of progeny. The facultative use of symmetric or asymmetric divisions by stem cells may be a key adaptation that is crucial for adult regenerative capacity.},

abstract = {Evolutionary theory explains why metazoan species are largely protected against the negative fit- ness effects of cancers. Nevertheless, cancer is often observed at high incidence across a range of species. Although there are many challenges to quantifying cancer epidemiology and assessing its causes, we claim that most modern-day cancer in animals – and humans in particular – are due to environments deviating from central tendencies of distributions that have prevailed during cancer resistance evolution. Such novel environmental conditions may be natural and/or of anthro- pogenic origin, and may interface with cancer risk in numerous ways, broadly classifiable as those: increasing organism body size and/or life span, disrupting processes within the organism, and affecting germline. We argue that anthropogenic influences, in particular, explain much of the pre- sent-day cancer risk across life, including in humans. Based on a literature survey of animal spe- cies and a parameterised mathematical model for humans, we suggest that combined risks of all cancers in a population beyond c. 5{\%} can be explained to some extent by the influence of novel environments. Our framework provides a basis for understanding how natural environmental vari- ation and human activity impact cancer risk, with potential implications for species ecology.},

	abstract = {The HEK cell line has been extensively used as an expression tool for recombinant proteins since it was generated over 25 years ago. Although of epithelial origin, its biochemical machinery is capable of carrying out most of the post-translational folding and processing required to generate functional, mature protein from a wide spectrum of both mammalian and non-mammalian nucleic acids. Though popular as a transient expression system, this cell type has also seen wide use in stably transfected forms (i.e. transformed cells) to study a variety of cell-biological questions in neurobiology. The principal attributes which have made the HEK cell a popular choice among electrophysiologists to study isolated receptor channels include; its quick and easy reproduction and maintenance; amenability to transfection using a wide variety of methods; high efficiency of transfection and protein production; faithful translation and processing of proteins; and small cell size with minimal processes appropriate for voltage-clamp experimentation. These, and other attributes, also mean that complementary biochemical/cell biological evaluations of expressed proteins can be performed in concert with functional analyses to establish detailed pharmacological and biophysical profiles for the action of new drugs and their targets. The increased amount of sequence information available from the human genome has placed greater emphasis upon heterologous cell expression systems as targets for high throughput structure-function evaluation of novel drug targets and disease markers. Here we have highlighted some of the innate characteristics of the HEK cell in order that its suitability as a vehicle for the expression of a gene product can be assessed for particular needs. We have also detailed some of the standard methods used for transfection and obtaining functional data from electrophysiological recording techniques. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Purpose There is growing evidence that inflammation is a central and reversible mechanism through which obesity promotes cancer risk and progression. Methods We review recent findings regarding obesity-associated alterations in the microenvironment and the local and systemic mechanisms through which these changes support tumor growth. Results Locally, hyperadiposity is associated with altered adipose tissue function, adipocyte death, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Most individuals who are obese harbor inflamed adipose tissue, which resembles chronically injured tissue, with immune cell infiltration and remodeling. Within this distinctly altered local environment, several pathophysiologic changes are found that may promote breast and other cancers. Consistently, adipose tissue inflammation is associated with a worse prognosis in patients with breast and tongue cancers. Systemically, the metabolic syndrome, in-cluding dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, occurs in the setting of adipose inflammation and operates in concert with local mechanisms to sustain the inflamed microenvironment and promote tumor growth. Importantly, adipose inflammation and its protumor consequences can be found in some individuals who are not considered to be obese or overweight by body mass index. Conclusion The tumor-promoting effects of obesity occur at the local level via adipose inflammation and as-sociated alterations in the microenvironment, as well as systemically via circulating metabolic and inflammatory mediators associated with adipose inflammation. Accurately characterizing the obese state and identifying patients at increased risk for cancer development and progression will likely require more precise assessments than body mass index alone. Biomarkers of adipose tissue inflammation would help to identify high-risk populations. Moreover, adipose inflammation is a reversible process and represents a novel therapeutic target that warrants further study to break the obesity-cancer link.},

abstract = {Estrogen-receptor (ER) status is an important parameter in breast cancer management as ER-positive breast cancers have a better prognosis than ER-negative tumors. This difference comes essentially from the lower aggres-siveness and invasiveness of ER-positive tumors. Here, we demonstrate, that interleukin-8 (IL-8) was clearly over-expressed in most ER-negative breast, ovary cell lines and breast tumor samples tested, whereas no significant IL-8 level could be detected in ER-positive breast or ovarian cell lines. We have also cloned human IL-8 from ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, and we show that IL-8 produced by breast cancer cells is identical to monocyte-derived IL-8. Interestingly, the invasion potential of ER-negative breast cancer cells is associated at least in part with expression of IL-8, but not with IL-8 receptor levels. Moreover, IL-8 increases the invasiveness of ER-positive breast cancer cells by two fold, thus confirming the invasion-promoting role of IL-8. On the other hand, exogenous expression of estrogen receptors in ER-negative cells led to a decrease of IL-8 levels. In summary, our data show that IL-8 expression is negatively linked to ER status of breast and ovarian cancer cells. We also support the idea that IL-8 expression is associated with a higher invasiveness potential of cancer cells in vitro, which suggests that IL-8 could be a novel marker of tumor aggressiveness.},

As we learn more about the normal mammary gland, we have begun to understand the complex signaling pathways underlying the dramatic shifts in the structure and function of breast tissue. Integrin-, growth factor-, and steroid hormone-signaling pathways all play an important part in maintaining tissue architecture; disruption of the delicate balance of signaling results in dramatic changes in the way cells interact with each other and with the extracellular matrix, leading to breast cancer. The extracellular matrix itself plays a central role in coordinating these signaling processes. In this review, we consider the interrelationships between the extracellular matrix, integrins, growth factors, and steroid hormones in mammary gland development and function.},

abstract = {Analysis of molecular aberrations across multiple cancer types, known as pan-cancer analysis, identifies commonalities and differences in key biological processes that are dysregulated in cancer cells from diverse lineages. Pan-cancer analyses have been performed for adult 1–4 but not paediatric cancers, which commonly occur in developing mesodermic rather than adult epithelial tissues 5 . Here we present a pan-cancer study of somatic alterations, including single nucleotide variants, small insertions or deletions, structural variations, copy number alterations, gene fusions and internal tandem duplications in 1,699 paediatric leukaemias and solid tumours across six histotypes, with whole-genome, whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing data processed under a uniform analytical framework. We report 142 driver genes in paediatric cancers, of which only 45{\%} match those found in adult pan-cancer studies; copy number alterations and structural variants constituted the majority (62{\%}) of events. Eleven genome-wide mutational signatures were identified, including one attributed to ultraviolet-light exposure in eight aneuploid leukaemias. Transcription of the mutant allele was detectable for 34{\%} of protein-coding mutations, and 20{\%} exhibited allele-specific expression. These data provide a comprehensive genomic architecture for paediatric cancers and emphasize the need for paediatric cancer-specific development of precision therapies. Paired tumour and normal samples from 1,699 patients with paediatric cancers enrolled in Children's Oncology Group clinical trials were analysed, including 689 B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (B-ALL), 267 T-lineage ALLs (T-ALL), 210 acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), 316 neuroblastomas (NBL), 128 Wilms tumours and 89 osteosarcomas (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). All tumour specimens were obtained at initial diagnosis, and 98.5{\%} of patients were 20 years of age or younger (see Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1d). The median somatic mutation rate ranged from 0.17 per million bases (Mb) in AML and Wilms tumours to 0.79 in osteosarcomas (Fig. 1a, b), lower than the 1–10 per Mb found in common adult cancers 6 . Genome-wide analysis (see Methods) identified 11 muta-tional signatures (T-1 through T-11; Fig. 1c–e and Supplementary Table 1a–c). Signatures T-1 through T-9 corresponded to known COSMIC signatures 7 , whereas T-10 and T-11 were novel but enriched in mutations with a low ({\textless} 0.3) mutant allele fraction (MAF). Signatures T-1 and T-4 (clock-like endogenous mutational processes) were present in all samples and contributed to large proportions of all mutations in T-ALL (97{\%}), AML (63{\%}), B-ALL (36{\%}), and Wilms tumours (28{\%}). T-2 and T-7 (APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like)) were highly enriched in B-ALLs with ETV6-RUNX1 fusions (15-fold and 9-fold enrichment for T-2 and T-7, respectively; Supplementary Table 1e). T-3 (homologous recombination deficiency) was present in many childhood cancers, including osteosarcomas (18 of 19), NBLs (59 of 137), Wilms tumours (28 of 81), and B-ALL (47 of 218). T-8 (8-oxoguanine DNA damage) was present in a small proportion (4.5–12{\%}) of AML, B-ALL, osteosar-coma, and Wilms tumour samples. T-8 was also present in many (36{\%}) NBL samples and was associated with age at diagnosis (Supplementary Table 1d). T-9 (DNA repair deficiency) was present in two B-ALLs, including one (sample PARJSR) with a somatic MSH6 frameshift mutation. T-2, T-3, T-5, T-7, T-8, and T-9 were enriched among the 39 samples with elevated mutation rates in each histotype (Fig. 1d). The T-5 ultraviolet-light (UV)-exposure signature was unexpectedly present in eight B-ALL samples (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). Although its mutation rate in B-ALL, ranging from 0.06 to 0.72 per Mb, was 100-fold lower than the average rate in adult (15.8 per Mb) 8},

abstract = {Breast cancers containing estrogen receptors are responsive to antiestrogen treatment and have a better prognosis than estrogen receptor-negative tumors. The loss of estrogen and progesterone receptors appears to be associated with a progression to less-differentiated tumors. We transfected the human estrogen receptor into the estrogen receptor-negative metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 in an attempt to restore their sensitivity to antiestrogens. Two stable sublines of MDA-MB-231 cells (HC1 and HE5) expressing functional estrogen receptors were studied for their ability to grow and invade in vitro and to metastasize in athymic nude mice. The number and size of lung metastases developed by these two sublines in ovariectomized nude mice was not markedly altered by tamoxifen but was inhibited 3-fold by estradiol. Estradiol also significantly inhibited in vitro cell proliferation of these sublines and their invasiveness in Matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane, whereas the antiestrogens 4-hydroxytamoxifen and ICI 164,384 reversed these effects. These results show that estradiol inhibits the metastatic ability of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells following transfection with the estrogen receptor, whereas estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers are stimulated by estrogen, indicating that factors other than the estrogen receptor are involved in progression toward hormone independence. Reactivation or transfer of the estrogen receptor gene can therefore be considered as therapeutic approaches to hormone-independent cancers.},

Here we present a comprehensive analysis of genetic alterations in a pan-cancer cohort including 961 tumours from children, adolescents, and young adults, comprising 24 distinct molecular types of cancer. Using a standardized workflow, we identified marked differences in terms of mutation frequency and significantly mutated genes in comparison to previously analysed adult cancers. Genetic alterations in 149 putative cancer driver genes separate the tumours into two classes: small mutation and structural/copy-number variant (correlating with germline variants).

abstract = {Human society is engaged in an arms race against cancer, which pits one evolutionary process – human cultural evolution as we develop novel cancer therapies – against another evolutionary process – the ability of oncogenic selection operating among cancer cells to select for lineages that are resistant to our therapies. Cancer cells have a powerful ability to evolve resistance over the short-term, leading to patient relapse following an initial period of apparent treatment efficacy. However, we are the beneficiaries of a fundamental asymmetry in our arms race against cancer: whereas our cultural evolution is a long-term and continuous process, resistance evolution in cancer cells operates only over the short-term, and is discontinuous: all resistance adaptations are lost each time a cancer patient dies. Thus, our cultural adaptations are permanent, whereas cancer's genetic adaptations are ephemeral. For this reason, over the long term, there is good reason to expect that we will emerge as the winners in our war against cancer. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A major obstacle in precision cancer medicine is the inevitable resistance to targeted therapies. Tremendous effort and progress has been made over the past few years to understand the biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying drug resistance, with the goal to eventually overcome such daunting challenges. Diverse mechanisms, such as secondary mutations, oncogene bypass, and epigenetic alterations, can all lead to drug resistance, and the number of known involved genes is growing rapidly, thus providing many possibilities to overcome resistance. The finding of these mechanisms and genes invariably requires the application of genomic and functional genomic approaches to tumors or cancer models. In this review, we briefly highlight the major drug-resistance mechanisms known today, and then focus primarily on the technological approaches leading to the advancement of this field. The emergence of drug resistance is a recurrent theme in targeted cancer therapies; thus, the understanding and conquering of drug resistance have become focal points in precision cancer medicine.While the biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying drug resistance are diverse and complex, the state-of-art technologies (high-throughput sequencing, functional genomics, model systems, etc.) leading to the understanding of such mechanisms have been a consistent force driving the advancement of this field.Although many genes have been found to impact drug resistance, the limited convergence from multiple studies indicates that we are still at the beginning stage of unearthing the entire drug-resistance repertoire. New genomic technologies, preclinical models, and computational methodologies are poised to further accelerate the development of this new field.},

abstract = {To perform their biological functions, individual genes exhibit varying ranges of expression levels. Thus, considering the intrinsic variability of gene expression can improve geneset-based functional analyses which are typically used to interpret transcriptome data. Through the extensive quantitative analysis of the expressional variability of individual genes using large collections of transcriptome and proteome data, we found the existence of the intrinsic variability of gene expression at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, genes under post-translational regulation were not sensitively regulated at the transcriptional level. Because genes have intrinsically different levels of regulation at the transcription and translation stages, the functional geneset-based interpretation of transcriptome data should only include genes that are significantly varied at the transcriptional level. Thus, by removing genes with low transcriptional variation from the DNA microarray data, we showed that geneset enrichment analysis could provide improved resolution in prioritizing target functional pathways in several different experimental datasets.},

Genomic biomarkers discovered in a 141 cell line training set were validated in an independent 359 cell line test set. We identified co-occurring and mutually exclusive genomic events that represent potential drivers and combinatorial targets in cancer. We demonstrate multiple cooperating genomic events that predict sensitivity to drug intervention independent of tumor lineage. The coupling of scalable in silico and biologic high throughput cancer cell line platforms for the identification of co-events in cancer delivers rational combinatorial targets for synthetic lethal approaches with a high potential to pre-empt the emergence of resistance.},

abstract = {The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) are two major studies that can be used to mine for therapeutic biomarkers for cancers of a large variety. Model validation using the two datasets however has proved challenging. Both predictions and signatures do not consistently validate well for models built on one dataset and tested on the other. While the genomic profiling seems consistent, the drug response data is not. Some efforts at harmonizing experimental designs has helped but not entirely removed model validation difficulties. In this paper, we present a partitioning strategy based on a data sharing concept which directly acknowledges a potential lack of concordance between datasets and in doing so, also allows for extraction of reproducible novel gene-drug interaction signatures as well as accurate test set predictions. We demonstrate these properties in a re-analysis of the GDSC and CCLE datasets. It's now widely believed that cancers are far more heterogeneous than once thought -that in fact, they represent a myriad of different diseases with varying biological determinants rather than a single entity whose effective treat-ment will rely on some over-arching theoretical construct of our understanding of the disease. To this end, high throughput pharmacogenomic screening of small molecules and other compounds has the potential to implicate new drug leads (or drug combinations) that can be used for more personalized treatments. A typical pharmacogenomic workflow involves characterizing interesting compounds for dose-response effects on cancer cell lines, and then doing functional genomic characterization in additional screens. Of interest is the elucidation of therapeutic biomarkers whose patterns might be predictive of a compound's activity against a particular cancer cell line. Given the complexity of such assays, the necessity of proper validation is paramount. Given a fresh set of data generated from the same workflow, one should be able to demonstrate both accurate predictions of drug activity as well as reproducibility of therapeutic genomic signatures.},

This study aimed to profile 84 genes in response to irra-diation at 660 nm. WS1 human skin fibroblasts were used in gene expression profiling studies in response to irradiation with a 660 nm diode laser at a fluence of 5 J/cm 2 and power density of 11 mW/ cm 2 . Forty-eight hours post-irradiation, 1 lg RNA was reverse transcribed and used in real-time qualita-tive polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Genes involved in the extracellular matrix and cell adhesion, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, growth factors and signal transduction were evaluated. A total of 76 genes were regulated by laser irradiation, 43 genes were up-regulated while 33 genes were down-regulated. Irradiation of WS1 cells at 660 nm modulates the expression of genes involved in colla-gen production, cellular adhesion, remodelling and spreading, the cytoskeleton, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, growth factors and molecules involved in signal transduction.},

abstract = {There have been enough cell death modes delineated in the biomedical literature to befuddle all cell death research-ers. Mulling over cell death from the viewpoints of the host tissue or organ and of the host animal, we construe that there should be only two physiological cell death modes, i.e. apoptosis and senescent death (SD), as well as two pathological modes, i.e. necrosis and stress-induced cell death (SICD). Other death modes described in the literature are ad-hoc variants or coalescences of some of these four basic ones in different physiological or pathological situa-tions. SD, SICD and necrosis kill useful cells and will thus trigger regeneration, wound healing and probably also scar formation. SICD and necrosis will likely instigate inflammation as well. Apoptosis occurs as a mechanism to purge no-longer useful cells from a tissue via phagocytosis by cells with phagocytic ability that are collectively tagged by us as scavengers, including macrophages; therefore apoptosis is not followed by regeneration and inflammation. The answer for the question of " who dies " clearly differentiates apoptosis from SD, SICD and necrosis, despite other similari-ties and disparities among the four demise modes. Apoptosis cannot occur in cell lines in vitro, because cell lines are immortalized by reprogramming the death program of the parental cells, because in culture there lack scavengers and complex communications among different cell types, and because culture condition is a stress to the cells. Sev-eral issues of cell death that remain enigmatic to us are also described for peers to deliberate and debate.},

This acquired drug resistance is largely due to drug-refractory sub-populations (subclones) within heterogeneous tumors. Here, we track the genetic and phenotypic sub-clonal evolution of four breast cancers through years of treatment to better understand how breast cancers become drug-resistant. Recurrently appearing post-chemotherapy mutations are rare. However, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing reveal acquisition of malignant phenotypes after treatment, including enhanced mesenchymal and growth factor signaling, which may promote drug resistance, and decreased antigen presentation and TNF-$\alpha$ sig-naling, which may enable immune system avoidance. Some of these phenotypes pre-exist in pre-treatment subclones that become dominant after chemotherapy, indicating selection for resistance phenotypes. Post-chemotherapy cancer cells are effectively treated with drugs targeting acquired phenotypes. These findings highlight cancer's ability to evolve phenoty-pically and suggest a phenotype-targeted treatment strategy that adapts to cancer as it evolves.},

abstract = {The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available 1 . Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical strati-fication schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emer-gence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens 2 . Human cancer cell lines represent a mainstay of tumour biology and drug discovery through facile experimental manipulation, global and detailed mechanistic studies, and various high-throughput applica-tions.

What happens during these first cell divisions may provide clues as to how to better prevent, detect and treat cancers. Because tumor growth is an evolutionary process and the ancestral history is recorded within tumor cell genomes 1–3 , detailed information on the early growth phase may be encoded in the patterns of genomic ITH present in the final neoplasm. Specifically, in the absence of selective sweeps, it is feasible to recover the genomic profile of the primordial tumor. This task is possible because private (subclonal) alterations, including copy number aberrations (CNAs) and point mutations, that occur early during growth should be 'pervasive' in the final neoplasm, where pervasive refers to private alterations that are found throughout the tumor but are not dominant. Experimentally, pervasive alterations can be detected through systematic sampling and genomic profiling of numerous regions of the same neoplasm. The initial events in neoplastic transformation are thought to occur through the stepwise accumulation of driver alterations 4 , whereas the growth dynamics of established neo-plasms remain poorly characterized. In particular, extensive ITH and branching phylogenies identified by cancer genomic studies 5–9 suggest that the same linear paradigm does not apply to the subsequent growth of established tumors, such as colorectal carcinomas and advanced ade-nomas. However, the origins of ITH are unknown, and a quantitative framework to describe the dynamics of tumor growth is needed. Here we propose a Big Bang model where, after the initial transfor-mation, colorectal tumors grow predominantly as a single expansion populated by numerous intermixed subclones (Fig. 1a). As expected, public alterations in the initiating cell will be present in all tumor cells (clonal). In contrast, although new private alterations will continuously be generated as a result of replication errors, only the earliest will be pervasive, whereas later alterations will be localized in progressively smaller tumor subpopulations. Although private alterations acquired during growth may confer survival advantages, selective sweeps that substantially alter the clonal composition of the final tumor are predicted to be extremely rare owing to the rapidly expanding population and spatial constraints 10–12 . Hence, the timing of an alteration rather than clonal selection for that alteration is the primary determinant of its pervasiveness. Notably, most observable private alterations that give rise to ITH are generated early after the transition to an advanced tumor, well before the neoplasm becomes clinically detectable. Given the absence of sequential selective sweeps, our model anticipates uniformly high levels of ITH throughout the neoplasm. Moreover, in some tumors, early subclone mixing followed by scattering to different distant tumor regions might occur (for example, Fig. 1a, red subclone). This phenomenon results in variegated tumor cell populations, where the spatial relationship between cells does not necessarily recapitulate their clonal relationship. An example of the variegation predicted by the Big Bang model is shown in Figure 1b. Progeny of the first initiating tumor cell propagate public alterations but also acquire new private alterations (colored areas), resulting in ITH within the newly formed small, primordial tumor, which can subsequently scatter to distant regions during growth. For instance, the earliest alterations (shown in red) can be scattered to opposite sides of the neoplasm during tumor expan-sion, despite remaining private and non-dominant.

abstract = {Intratumor heterogeneity has been widely reported in human cancers, but our knowledge of how this genetic diversity emerges over time remains limited. A central challenge in studying tumor evolution is the difficulty in collecting longitudinal samples from cancer patients. Consequently, most studies have inferred tumor evolution from single time-point samples, providing very indirect information. These data have led to several competing models of tumor evolution: linear, branching, neutral and punctuated. Each model makes different assumptions regarding the timing of mutations and selection of clones, and therefore has different implications for the diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of cancer patients. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that models may change during tumor progression or operate concurrently for different classes of mutations. Finally, we discuss data that supports the theory that most human tumors evolve from a single cell in the normal tissue.},

abstract = {Preclinical cellular response profiling of tumor models has become a cornerstone in the development of novel cancer therapeutics. As efforts to predict clinical efficacy using cohorts of in vitro tumor models have been successful, expansive panels of tumor-derived cell lines can recapitulate an "all comers" efficacy trial, thereby identifying which tumors are most likely to benefit from treatment. The response profile of a therapy is most often studied in isolation; however, drug treatment effect patterns in tumor models across a diverse panel of compounds can help determine the value of unique molecular target classes in specific tumor cohorts. To this end, a panel of 19 compounds was evaluated against a diverse group of cancer cell lines (n = 311). The primary oncogenic targets were a key determinant of concentration-dependent proliferation response, as a total of five of six, four of four, and five of five phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), and mitotic inhibitors, respectively, clustered with others of that common target class. In addition, molecular target class was correlated with increased responsiveness in certain histologies. A cohort of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors was more efficacious in breast cancers compared with other tumor types, whereas IGF-IR inhibitors more selectively inhibited growth in colon cancer lines. Finally, specific phenotypes play an important role in cellular response profiles. For example, luminal breast cancer cells (nine of nine; 100{\%}) segregated from basal cells (six of seven; 86{\%}). The convergence of a common cellular response profile for different molecules targeting the same oncogenic pathway substantiates a rational clinical path for patient populations most likely to benefit from treatment.

abstract = {If the occurrence of cancer is the result of a random lottery among cells, then body mass, a surrogate for cells number, should predict cancer incidence. Despite some support in humans, this assertion does not hold over the range of different natural animal species where cancer incidence is known. Explaining the so-called 'Peto's paradox' is likely to increase our understanding of how cancer defense mechanisms are shaped by natural selection. Here, we study how body mass may affect the evolutionary dynamics of tumor suppressor gene (TSG) inactivation and oncogene activation in natural animal species. We show that the rate of TSG inactivation should evolve to lower values along a gradient of body mass in a nonlinear manner, having a threshold beyond which benefits to adaptive traits cannot overcome their costs. We also show that oncogenes may be frequently activated within populations of large organisms. We then propose experimental settings that can be employed to identify protection mechanisms against cancer. We finally highlight fundamental species traits that natural selection should favor against carcinogenesis. We conclude on the necessity of comparing genomes between populations of a single species or genomes between species to better understand how evolution has molded protective mechanisms against cancer development and associated mortality.},

Recent results suggest that the strict hierarchical structure of cancer cell populations advocated by the cancer stem cell model must be reconsidered since the depletion of cancer stem cells leads the other tumor cells to switch back into the cancer stem cell phenotype. This plasticity has important implications for metastasis since migrating cells do not need to be cancer stem cells in order to seed a metastasis. We also discuss the important role of the immune system and the microenvironment in modulating phenotypic switching and suggest possible avenues to exploit our understanding of this process to develop an effective strategy for precision medicine.},

While in normal colonic mucosa, clonal repopulation occurs along differentiation gradients from crypt base toward crypt apex, the clonal architecture of colon cancer and the relevance of tumor cell subpopulations for clonal outgrowth are poorly understood. Using a multicolor lineage tracing approach in colon cancer xenografts that reflect primary colon cancer architecture, we here demonstrate that clonal outgrowth is mainly driven by tumor cells located at the leading tumor edge with clonal axis formation toward the tumor center. While our findings are compatible with lineage outgrowth in a cancer stem cell model, they suggest that in color-ectal cancer tumor cell position may be more important for clonal outgrowth than tumor cell phenotype.},

abstract = {Recent studies using the isolation of a subpopulation of tumour cells followed by their transplantation into immunodeficient mice provide evidence that certain tumours, including squamous skin tumours, contain cells with high clonogenic potential that have been referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Until now, CSC properties have only been investigated by transplantation assays, and their existence in unperturbed tumour growth is unproven. Here we make use of clonal analysis of squamous skin tumours using genetic lineage tracing to unravel the mode of tumour growth in vivo in its native environment. To this end, we used a genetic labelling strategy that allows individual tumour cells to be marked and traced over time at different stages of tumour progression. Surprisingly, we found that the majority of labelled tumour cells in benign papilloma have only limited proliferative potential, whereas a fraction has the capacity to persist long term, giving rise to progeny that occupy a significant part of the tumour. As well as confirming the presence of two distinct proliferative cell compartments within the papilloma, mirroring the composition, hierarchy and fate behaviour of normal tissue, quantitative analysis of clonal fate data indicates that the more persistent population has stem-cell-like characteristics and cycles twice per day, whereas the second represents a slower cycling transient population that gives rise to terminally differentiated tumour cells. Such behaviour is shown to be consistent with double-labelling experiments and detailed clonal fate characteristics. By contrast, measurements of clone size and proliferative potential in invasive squamous cell carcinoma show a different pattern of behaviour, consistent with geometric expansion of a single CSC population with limited potential for terminal differentiation. This study presents the first experimental evidence for the existence of CSCs during unperturbed solid tumour growth.},

Separately, each of these improvements will undoubtedly lead to improvements in the treatment of cancer patients but to fulfill the promise of truly personalized can-cer medicine, we must bring these disciplines together in a truly multidisciplinary fashion. Introduction —If one were to make the argument that the last decade has been focused to a large degree on the sequencing of large numbers of cancer genomes, then arguably we stand on the cusp of undertaking the next bold experiment in cancer thera-peutics, namely the large-scale systematic identification of therapeutics to target all known molecular subtypes in human cancer. There are undoubtedly significant challenges to be over-come and which are addressed within this review, but equally exciting are recent advances in cell engineering, cancer orga-noid derivation, CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screens, robotics, and computational approaches to big data analysis (to name but a few) that have the potential to revolutionize the stratification of patients for cancer treatment. One thing is clear—the current fail-ure rate for new cancer drugs to enter into the clinic, often due to an imperfect knowledge of which cancers are most likely to be sensitive to treatment, is not sustainable for either the pharma-ceutical industry or indeed cancer patients.

To better understand the mechanisms by which estrogens and antiestrogens modulate breast cancer growth in vivo, we have studied the effects of endocrine manip ulation on the development and growth of tumors derived from cultured human breast cancer cells in the athymic nude mouse. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were inoculated into 6-week-old fe male BALB/c athymic nude mice. Tumor growth did not occur in ovariectomized mice. Cells remained viable, however, since estrogen supplementation more than 30 days later resulted in tumor formation. Minimal tumor growth was observed in intact female nude mice which have low circulating estrogen levels. Tumor development and growth in ovariectomized or intact mice supplemented with 17{\^{}}-estradiol in the form of a s.c. pellet were dose dependent; growth rates increased with estrogen doses ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 mg. Antiestrogen treatment with either tamoxifen or LY156758 caused transient stimulation of tumor growth, followed by a prolonged stationary phase. Growth re sumed with estrogen supplementation. Treatment of mice bear ing established MCF-7 tumors with estrogen withdrawal (removal of estrogen pellet) resulted in cessation of tumor growth, but not in tumor regression. Growth inhibition was also observed with antiestrogens and was dose dependent. However, tumor regres sion did not occur, even in mice treated with high doses of tamoxifen (serum concentration of 1.0 {\^{A}}¿tw) for as long as 60 days. Tumor growth was restored in these mice with estrogen replenishment. Tumor cells also remained viable histologically despite prolonged (1 month) estrogen deprivation or antiestrogen therapy, although the mitotic index was markedly reduced. Sim ilar observations were made with mice inoculated with the hor mone-responsive ZR75-1 human breast cancer cells, but not with hormone-independent MDA-231 cells which were not influ enced by estrogen or antiestrogen treatment. In summary, de velopment and growth of MCF-7 and ZR75-1 tumors in nude mice are estrogen dependent. Endocrine therapy by estrogen deprivation or antiestrogen treatment inhibits tumor cell prolifer ation in nude mice, but does not cause tumor regression or loss of cell viability.},

To validate this hypothesis, we developed and applied a residue-centric patient presentation score to 9,176 cancer patients across 1,018 recurrent oncogenic mutations. We found that patient MHC-I genotype-based scores could predict which mutations were more likely to emerge in their tumor. Accordingly, poor presentation of a mutation across patients was correlated with higher frequency among tumors. These results support that MHC-I genotype-restricted immunoediting during tumor formation shapes the landscape of oncogenic mutations observed in clinically diagnosed tumors and paves the way for predicting personal cancer susceptibilities from knowledge of MHC-I genotype.},

abstract = {Cancer next-generation sequencing and genomics studies published over the last five years have provided unprecedented insights into the forces shaping cancer genome evolution. In particular, these studies have revealed a high level of heterogeneity not only between different tumours, but also within individual tumours; the 'cancer genome' may evolve along several independent trajectories within a single tumour. There is an increasing appreciation of the importance of intratumour genetic heterogeneity in determining disease progression and clinical outcome in cancer medicine, and thus an increasing awareness of the need to understand the processes that both generate genetic diversity and shape genome evolution in human tumours.},

abstract = {Genome sequencing has uncovered a new mutational phenomenon in cancer and congenital disorders called chromothripsis. Chromothripsis is characterized by extensive genomic rearrangements and an oscillating pattern of DNA copy number levels, all curiously restricted to one or a few chromosomes. The mechanism for chromothripsis is unknown, but we previously proposed that it could occur through the physical isolation of chromosomes in aberrant nuclear structures called micronuclei. Here, using a combination of live cell imaging and single-cell genome sequencing, we demonstrate that micronucleus formation can indeed generate a spectrum of genomic rearrangements, some of which recapitulate all known features of chromothripsis. These events are restricted to the mis-segregated chromosome and occur within one cell division. We demonstrate that the mechanism for chromothripsis can involve the fragmentation and subsequent reassembly of a single chromatid from a micronucleus. Collectively, these experiments establish a new mutational process of which chromothripsis is one extreme outcome.},

abstract = {SUMMARY All cancers carry somatic mutations. The patterns of mutation in cancer genomes reflect the DNA damage and repair processes to which cancer cells and their precursors have been exposed. To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single-and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex rela-tionships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed ''kataegis,'' was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases is proposed.},

abstract = {Genomic analysis provides insights into the role of copy number variation in disease, but most methods are not designed to resolve mixed populations of cells. In tumours, where genetic heterogeneity is common 1–3 , very important information may be lost that would be useful for reconstructing evolutionary history. Here we show that with flow-sorted nuclei, whole genome amplification and next generation sequencing we can accurately quantify genomic copy number within an individual nucleus. We apply single-nucleus sequencing to investigate tumour population structure and evolu-tion in two human breast cancer cases. Analysis of 100 single cells from a polygenomic tumour revealed three distinct clonal subpopu-lations that probably represent sequential clonal expansions. Additional analysis of 100 single cells from a monogenomic primary tumour and its liver metastasis indicated that a single clonal expan-sion formed the primary tumour and seeded the metastasis. In both primary tumours, we also identified an unexpectedly abundant sub-population of genetically diverse 'pseudodiploid' cells that do not travel to the metastatic site. In contrast to gradual models of tumour progression, our data indicate that tumours grow by punctuated clonal expansions with few persistent intermediates. In single-nucleus sequencing (SNS), we isolate nuclei by flow-sort-ing and amplify DNA using whole genome amplification (WGA) for massively parallel sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 1). We achieve low coverage (,6{\%}) of the genome of a single cell, sufficient to quantify copy number from sequence read depth. Several features of our data analysis were designed for SNS and differ from previous methods 4–6 for measuring copy number from sequencing data. In contrast to using fixed intervals to calculate copy number, we use variable length bins but with uniform expected unique counts, which correct for biases that have been reported 7–9 in WGA (Supplementary Fig. 2; see Methods). For each single cell, we typically achieve a mean read density of 138 per bin (standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) 6 5.55, n 5 200). Over-replicated loci called 'pileups', which have been previously reported in WGA 10–12},

abstract = {Epiregulin is a new member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family purified from conditioned medium of NIH-3T3 clone T7. Some EGF family growth factors play essential roles in human keratinocytes in an autocrine manner. We show here that epiregulin is another autocrine growth factor for human keratinocytes. Epiregulin stimulated human keratinocyte proliferation under both subconfluent and confluent culture conditions in the absence of exogenous EGF family growth factors. Immunoprecipitation of [(35)S]methionine-labeled conditioned medium revealed a 5-kDa band corresponding to epiregulin. Northern blot analysis detected a 4. 8-kilobase transcript of epiregulin, and the addition of epiregulin up-regulated epiregulin mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, an anti-epiregulin blocking antibody reduced DNA synthesis by 25{\%}. Epiregulin up-regulated the mRNA levels of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), amphiregulin, and TGF-alpha. In turn, the addition of EGF, HB-EGF, amphiregulin, and TGF-alpha increased epiregulin mRNA levels. These results demonstrate that epiregulin acts as an autocrine growth factor in human epidermal keratinocytes and is part of auto- and cross-induction mechanisms involving HB-EGF, amphiregulin, and TGF-alpha. The mRNA expression profile resulting from induction of differentiation with high calcium and fetal calf serum revealed the differential expression of epiregulin, HB-EGF, amphiregulin, and TGF-alpha in keratinocytes. This indicates that these four growth factors have distinct, non-redundant biological functions.},

abstract = {Due to the presence of both classical estrogen receptor (ER$\alpha$) and another ER subtype (ER$\beta$) in ovarian cancer, hormonal treatment is an attractive option. However, response to tamoxifen in ovarian cancer is modest. The presence of ER$\beta$ variants further complicated the issue. We have recently shown that specifically targeting ER subtypes using selective ER modulators showed opposing functions of ER subtypes on cell growth. In the present study, the clinical significance of ER$\alpha$ and ER$\beta$ variants ($\beta$1, $\beta$2 and $\beta$5) and the functional effects of ER$\beta$2 and ER$\beta$5 in ovarian cancer was investigated. ER$\alpha$, ER$\beta$1, ER$\beta$2 and ER$\beta$5 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 106 ovarian cancer tissues. The association between ERs expression and clinicopathological parameters or prognosis was analyzed. Ectopic expression of ER$\beta$2 and ER$\beta$5 followed by functional assays were performed in ovarian cancer cell lines in order to detect their effects on cell invasion and proliferation. We found significantly higher nuclear (n)ER$\alpha$ and nER$\beta$5 and lower cytoplasmic (c)ER$\alpha$ expression in advanced cancers. Significantly lower ER$\beta$1 expression was also detected in high grade cancers. Significant loss of nER$\alpha$ and cER$\beta$2 expression were observed in clear cell histological subtypes. Higher nER$\beta$5 and lower cER$\beta$5 expression were associated with serous/clear cell subtypes, poor disease-free and overall survival. Positive cER$\alpha$ and higher cER$\beta$1 expression were significantly associated with better disease-free and overall survival. Furthermore, we found nER$\beta$5 as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Functionally, overexpression of ER$\beta$5 enhanced ovarian cancer cell migration, invasion and proliferation via FAK/c-Src activation whereas ER$\beta$2 induced cell migration and invasion. Since tamoxifen binds to both ER$\alpha$ and ER$\beta$1 which appear to bear opposing oncogenic roles, the histotypes-specific expression pattern of ERs indicates that personalized treatment for women based on ERs expression using selective estrogen receptor modulators may improve response rate. This study also suggests nER$\beta$5 as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in ovarian cancer.},

The present study reports the conditions for primary culture of breast cancer samples from untreated patients and the most effective collagenization method to dissociate human samples consisting in an overnight incubation with 1 mg/ml types II or IV collagenase and further incubation in DMEM:F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with glutamine, bovine insulin, penicillin-streptomycin, HEPES, estradiol, cortisol (F), tri-iodothyronine (T(3)), transferrine (TR), and 10{\%} fetal calf serum (FCS). These conditions proved to be appropriate for both primary culture and the development of stable cell lines. Of the seven cell lines obtained, three fast growing and estrogen receptor (ER)+/progesterone receptor (PgR)+/EGF receptor (EGFR)+ have been characterized. The cells are able to grow both in soft agar and in nude mice, and express cytokeratins, all parameters characteristic of malignant epithelial cell lines. The cells also exhibit an increased proliferation rate in the presence of estradiol, progesterone, and EGF, suggesting the presence of the corresponding receptors. The mRNA expression of type alpha- and beta-ER as well as EGFR, was confirmed by RT-PCR. In conclusion, the novel cell lines described, arose from primary tumors and are sensitive to estradiol, progesterone, and EGF. This not only expands the repertoire of breast cancer cells available as potentially useful tools for examining most parameters in breast cancer "in vitro", but also provides unique new models to explore the complex regulation by steroids as well as growth factors in such cells.},

Several recent studies even suggest a need to re-evaluate established models of mammalian TF net-works. Here, we provide a brief overview of current and emerging methods to define mammalian TF net-works. We also discuss how these emerging technologies facilitate new ways to interrogate complex TF networks, consider the current open questions in the field, and comment on potential future directions and biomedical applications. Introduction During mammalian development, hundreds of unique cell types are specified in a complex spatiotemporal patterning process. In adults, stem and progenitor cell populations replenish mature cell types to maintain tissue homeostasis throughout life. Concerted gene expression programs are responsible for these fundamental biological processes and the underlying cell fate decisions. Transcription represents a major control point in gene expression (Figure 1A) and occurs within the context of chromatin. Precise spatial and temporal expression of combina-tions of a limited number of genes (20,000 in humans) appears to be responsible for the intricate cellular processes of develop-mental specification and adult tissue homeostasis. Sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) are a large class of DNA-binding proteins that play central roles in regulating gene transcription, and account for almost 7{\%} of genes (1,400) in the human genome (Vaquerizas et al., 2009). TFs regulate gene promoter activity, but often act via interactions with other genomic locations that can be distant in primary DNA sequence. These are broadly defined as gene regulatory regions (Kellis et al., 2014), with an important subclass of posi-tive regulatory regions being termed enhancers. Enhancers are composed of TF binding sites (TFBSs) or DNA motifs, which are commonly short (4–12 nucleotides) (Jolma et al., 2013). Such motifs, therefore, frequently occur by chance in mammalian genomes, and individual TF-DNA interactions can be weak. TF-DNA interactions must compete with histone-DNA interac-tions for stable and productive binding. Cooperativity in TF bind-ing is therefore common, such as through protein-protein inter-actions with other TFs, co-activators, and/or co-repressors (Vaquerizas et al., 2009).},

abstract = {Background: Epiregulin (EPR) is a novel member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family. It has been shown to promote wound healing in oral epithelium, enhance proliferation of other epithelial tissues, and is involved in several epithelial-related malignancies such as colorectal, lung, and bladder carcinoma. More recently, EPR transcripts were found to be high in a study on archival oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) specimens. This implies that EPR may be responsible for the progression of OSCC. The aim of this was to elucidate the effects of EPR on (i) cell morphological changes, (ii) cell proliferation and (iii) receptor expression of the H-series OSCC cell lines. Methods: The clinicopathological origin and the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB4 receptors of the H-series cell lines were initially characterised. Based on these parameters, two of the H-series cell lines, namely H103 and H357 were selected for downstream experiments. The cell lines were treated with 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, and 20 ng/ml of EPR for 24 and 48 hours in all subsequent experiments. Untreated cells acted as the control which was used for comparison with each treated group. The cell morphological changes, cell proliferation and receptor expression of the OSCC cell lines were evaluated using phase contrast microscopy, 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) assays and flow cytometry respectively. The results were compared and analysed using the student t-test. Results: There were no appreciable morphological changes in the cells regardless of the dose of EPR tested nor between the different timelines. There were no significant changes in cell proliferation after EPR treatment. As for the effect of EPR on receptor expression, 20 ng/ml of EPR significantly reduced the density of EGFR expression (p value = 0.049) in the H103 cell line after the 24-hour treatment. No other statistically significant changes were detected. Conclusions: The results show that EPR had no effect on the morphology and proliferativity of OSCC cells. However, the significant decline in EGFR expression after EPR treatment suggests that EPR might play an important role in the regulation of EGFR expression and hence OSCC progression.},

abstract = {Increased transcription of oncogenes like the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently caused by amplification of the whole gene or at least of regulatory sequences. Aim of this study was to pinpoint mechanistic parameters occurring during egfr copy number gains leading to a stable EGFR overexpression and high sensitivity to extracellular signalling. A deeper understanding of those marker events might improve early diagnosis of cancer in suspect lesions, early detection of cancer progression and the prediction of egfr targeted therapies. The basal-like/stemness type breast cancer cell line subpopulation MDA-MB-468 CD44high/CD24-/low, carrying high egfr amplifications, was chosen as a model system in this study. Subclones of the heterogeneous cell line expressing low and high EGF receptor densities were isolated by cell sorting. Genomic profiling was carried out for these by means of SNP array profiling, qPCR and FISH. Cell cycle analysis was performed using the BrdU quenching technique. Low and high EGFR expressing MDA-MB-468 CD44+/CD24-/low subpopulations separated by cell sorting showed intermediate and high copy numbers of egfr, respectively. However, during cell culture an increase solely for egfr gene copy numbers in the intermediate subpopulation occurred. This shift was based on the formation of new cells which regained egfr gene copies. By two parametric cell cycle analysis clonal effects mediated through growth advantage of cells bearing higher egfr gene copy numbers could most likely be excluded for being the driving force. Subsequently, the detection of a fragile site distal to the egfr gene, sustaining uncapped telomere-less chromosomal ends, the ladder-like structure of the intrachromosomal egfr amplification and a broader range of egfr copy numbers support the assumption that dynamic chromosomal rearrangements, like breakage-fusion-bridge-cycles other than proliferation drive the gain of egfr copies. Progressive genome modulation in the CD44+/CD24-/low subpopulation of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 leads to different coexisting subclones. In isolated low-copy cells asymmetric chromosomal segregation leads to new cells with regained solely egfr gene copies. Furthermore, egfr regain resulted in enhanced signal transduction of the MAP-kinase and PI3-kinase pathway. We show here for the first time a dynamic copy number regain in basal-like/stemness cell type breast cancer subpopulations which might explain genetic heterogeneity. Moreover, this process might also be involved in adaptive growth factor receptor intracellular signaling which support survival and migration during cancer development and progression.},

abstract = {One contribution of 18 to a theme issue 'Cancer across life: Peto's paradox and the promise of comparative oncology'. Peto's paradox is the lack of the expected trend in cancer incidence as a func-tion of body size and lifespan across species. The leading hypothesis to explain this pattern is natural selection for differential cancer prevention in larger, longer lived species. We evaluate whether a similar effect exists within species, specifically humans. We begin by reanalysing a recently pub-lished dataset to separate the effects of stem cell number and replication rate, and show that each has an independent effect on cancer risk. When consid-ering the lifetime number of stem cell divisions in an extended dataset, and removing cases associated with other diseases or carcinogens, we find that lifetime cancer risk per tissue saturates at approximately 0.3 –1.3{\%} for the types considered. We further demonstrate that grouping by anatomical site explains most of the remaining variation. Our results indicate that cancer risk depends not only on the number of stem cell divisions but varies enormously (approx. 10 000 times) depending on anatomical site. We conclude that variation in risk of human cancer types is analogous to the paradoxical lack of variation in cancer incidence among animal species and may likewise be understood as a result of evolution by natural selection.},

abstract = {Recent cancer research has investigated the possibility that non-cell-autonomous (NCA) driving tumor growth can support clonal diversity (CD). Indeed, mutations can affect the phenotypes not only of their carriers (" cell-autonomous " , CA effects), but also sometimes of other cells (NCA effects). However, models that have investigated this phenomenon have only considered a restricted number of clones. Here, we designed an individual-based model of tumor evolution, where clones grow and mutate to yield new clones, among which a given frequency have NCA effects on other clones' growth. Unlike previously observed for smaller assemblages, most of our simulations yield lower CD with high frequency of mutations with NCA effects. Owing to NCA effects increasing competition in the tumor, clones being already dominant are more likely to stay dominant, and emergent clones not to thrive. These results may help personalized medicine to predict intratumor heterogeneity across different cancer types for which frequency of NCA effects could be quantified.},

@article{Carja2017,
abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is an evolutionary driving force in diverse biological processes, including the adaptive immune system, the development of neoplasms, and the persistence of pathogens despite drug pressure. It is essential, therefore, to understand the evolutionary advantage of an allele that confers on cells the ability to express a range of phenotypes. Here, we study the fate of a new mutation that allows the expression of multiple phenotypic states, introduced into a finite population of individuals that can express only a single phenotype. We show that the advantage of such a mutation depends on the degree of phenotypic heritability between generations, called phenotypic memory. We analyze the fixation probability of the phenotypically plastic allele as a function of phenotypic memory, the variance of expressible phenotypes, the rate of environmental changes, and the population size. We find that the fate of a phenotypically plastic allele depends fundamentally on the environmental regime. In constant environments, plastic alleles are advantageous and their fixation probability increases with the degree of phenotypic memory. In periodically fluctuating environments, by contrast, there is an optimum phenotypic memory that maximizes the probability of the plastic allele's fixation. This same optimum memory also maximizes geometric mean fitness, in steady state. We interpret these results in the context of previous studies in an infinite-population framework. We also discuss the implications of our results for the design of therapies that can overcome persistence and, indirectly, drug resistance. Perpetual volatility in the surrounding microenvironment, nutrient availability, temperature, immune surveil-lance, antibiotics or other drugs are realities of life as a microorganism 1–3 . To persist in constantly changing environments and increase resilience, microbial populations often employ mechanisms that expand the range of phenotypes that can be expressed by a given genotype 3, 4 . This form of bet-hedging may not confer an immediate fitness benefit to any one individual, but it can sometimes act to increase the long-term survival and growth of an entire lineage 5, 6 . Phenotypic heterogeneity has been well documented both in the context of cellular noise without any known environmental triggers 7 and in the context of persistent environmental challenges 8 . Classic examples include the bifurcation of a genotypically monomorphic population into two phenotypically distinct bistable subpopu-lations 1 , or phase variation, a reversible switch between different phenotypic states driven by differences in gene expression 3, 4, 9 . In order to motivate our modeling study, we first describe and compare four clinically relevant examples of phenotypic bet-hedging. One of the most striking examples of evolutionary bet-hedging is bacterial persistence 6, 10–12 , whereby a genet-ically monomorphic bacterial population survives periods of large antibiotic concentrations by producing phe-notypically heterogeneous sub-populations, some of which are drug-insensitive 13 . Persister phenotypes constitute dormant, transient phenotypic (epi)states, protected from the action of drugs. Phenotypic variants that can sur-vive treatment differ from traditional resistance mutants, because the dormant phenotypes do not rely on genetic mutations 13 , though the mechanisms that lead to persistence are still under debate. The dormant phenotypic state can be partially heritable upon cellular division, so that the offspring cell can " remember " and express the phe-notypic state of its parent with a certain probability. In such bacterial populations, individuals typically acquire and relinquish the dormant phenotype at rates that exceed the rate of DNA mutation 14, 15},

abstract = {The unwelcome evolution of malignancy during cancer progression emerges through a selection process in a complex heterogeneous population structure. In the present work, we investigate evolutionary dynamics in a phenotypically heterogeneous population of stem cells (SCs) and their associated progenitors. The fate of a malignant mutation is determined not only by overall stem cell and non-stem cell growth rates but also differentiation and dedif-ferentiation rates. We investigate the effect of such a complex population structure on the evolution of malignant mutations. We derive exactly calculated results for the fixation proba-bility of a mutant arising in each of the subpopulations. The exactly calculated results are in almost perfect agreement with the numerical simulations. Moreover, a condition for evolu-tionary advantage of a mutant cell versus the wild type population is given in the present study. We also show that microenvironment-induced plasticity in invading mutants leads to more aggressive mutants with higher fixation probability. Our model predicts that decreasing polarity between stem and non-stem cells' turnover would raise the survivability of non-plastic mutants; while it would suppress the development of malignancy for plastic mutants. The derived results are novel and general with potential applications in nature; we discuss our model in the context of colorectal/intestinal cancer (at the epithelium). However, the model clearly needs to be validated through appropriate experimental data. This novel mathematical framework can be applied more generally to a variety of problems concerning selection in heterogeneous populations, in other contexts such as population genetics, and ecology.},

abstract = {Living cells, like whole living organisms during evolution, communicate with their neighbors, interact with the environment, divide, change their phenotypes, and eventually die. The development of specific ways of communication (through signaling molecules and receptors) allows some cellular subpopulations to survive better, to coordinate their physiological status, and during embryonal development to create tissues and organs or in some conditions to become tumors. Populations of cells cultured in vitro interact similarly, also competing for space and nutrients and stimulating each other to better survive or to die. The results of these intercellular interactions of different types seem to be good examples of biological evolutionary games, and have been the subjects of simulations by the methods of evolutionary game theory where individual cells are treated as players. Here we present examples of intercellular contacts in a population of living human cancer HeLa cells cultured in vitro and propose an evolutionary game theory approach to model the development of such populations. We propose a new technique termed Mixed Spatial Evolutionary Games (MSEG) which are played on multiple lattices corresponding to the possible cellular phenotypes which gives the possibility of simulating and investigating the effects of heterogeneity at the cellular level in addition to the population level. Analyses performed with MSEG suggested different ways in which cellular populations develop in the case of cells communicating directly and through factors released to the environment.},

abstract = {The extensive intratumor heterogeneity revealed by sequencing cancer genomes is an essential determinant of tumor progression, diagnosis, and treatment. What maintains heterogeneity remains an open question because competition within a tumor leads to a strong selection for the fittest subclone. Cancer cells also coop- erate by sharing molecules with paracrine effects, such as growth factors, and heterogeneity can be maintained if subclones depend on each other for survival. Without strict interdependence be- tween subclones, however, nonproducer cells can free-ride on the growth factors produced by neighboring producer cells, a collective action problem known in game theory as the “tragedy of the commons,” which has been observed in microbial cell populations. Here, we report that similar dynamics occur in cancer cell popula- tions. Neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer (insulinoma) cells that do not produce insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) grow slowly in pure cultures but have a proliferation advantage in mixed cultures, where they can use the IGF-II provided by producer cells. We show that, as predicted by evolutionary game theory, producer cells do not go extinct because IGF-II acts as a nonlinear public good, cre- ating negative frequency-dependent selection that leads to a sta- ble coexistence of the two cell types. Intratumor cell heterogeneity can therefore be maintained even without strict interdependence between cell subclones. Reducing the amount of growth factors available within a tumor may lead to a reduction in growth fol- lowed by a new equilibrium, which may explain relapse in thera- pies that target growth factors.},

abstract = {Clinical risk assessment for cancer predisposition includes a three-generation pedigree and physical examination to identify inherited syndromes. Additionally genetic and genomic biomarkers may identify individuals with a constitutional basis for their disease that may not be evident clinically. Genomic biomarker testing may detect molecular variations in single genes, panels of genes, or entire genomes. The strength of evidence for the association of a genomic biomarker with disease risk may be weak or strong. The factors contributing to clinical validity and utility of genomic biomarkers include functional laboratory analyses and genetic epidemiologic evidence. Genomic biomarkers may be further classified as low, moderate or highly penetrant based on the likelihood of disease. Genomic biomarkers for breast cancer are comprised of rare highly penetrant mutations of genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, moderately penetrant mutations of genes such as CHEK2, as well as more common genomic variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, associated with modest effect sizes. When applied in the context of appropriate counseling and interpretation, identification of genomic biomarkers of inherited risk for breast cancer may decrease morbidity and mortality, allow for definitive prevention through assisted reproduction, and serve as a guide to targeted therapy .},

abstract = {A coculture system was developed to investigate the interactions between MCF-10A breast epithelial cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells stably expressing the green fluorescent protein (MCF-7-GFP). Studies with this MCF-10A/MCF-7-GFP coculture system on microtiter plates and on reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel), revealed paracrine inhibition of MCF-7-GFP cell proliferation. Epidermal growth factor, which in monocultures modestly enhanced MCF-7-GFP and markedly increased MCF-10A cell proliferation, greatly inhibited MCF-7-GFP cell proliferation in MCF-10A/MCF-7-GFP cocultures. 17$\beta$-Estradiol, which stimulated MCF-7-GFP but not MCF-10A cell proliferation in monoculture, inhibited MCF-7-GFP cell proliferation in MCF-10A/MCF-7-GFP cocultures, an effect that was blocked by the antiestrogen, ICI 182,780. On Matrigel, complex MCF-10A/MCF-7-GFP cellular interactions were observed in real time that resulted in the formation of acinus-like structures. These results indicate a role of normal epithelial cells in inhibiting tumor-cell proliferation and demonstrate the utility of this coculture system as a model of early paracrine control of breast cancer. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Federation for Cell Biology.

@article{Simpson1997,
abstract = {Much recent attention has been paid to the important role of the DNA mismatch repair system in controlling the accumulation of somatic mutations in human tissues and the association of mismatch repair deficiency with carcinogenesis. In the absence of an intact mismatch repair system, cells accumulate mutations at a rate some 1000 times faster than normal cells, and this mutator phenotype is easily measured by the detection of the formation of new variant alleles at microsatellite loci. However, the mismatch repair system is not 100{\%} efficient, even when intact, and the pattern of microsatellite alterations in a wide variety of tumors is consistent with these being due to clonal amplification from tissues that are genetically heterogeneous at microsatellite loci rather than mismatch repair deficiency in the tumor itself. On this basis, it can be estimated that the mutation frequency of microsatellites in normal human tissues is approximately 10(-2) per locus per cell. Similarly, a frequency of mutation at minisatellite loci in normal tissues of around 10(-1) per locus per cell can be estimated. Such elevated levels of mutation are consistent with a recent study of the frequency of HPRT mutation in human kidneys that demonstrated these to be frequent (average 2.5 x 10(-4) in individuals of 70 years or more) and exponentially related to age. Taken as a whole, the data suggest that somatic mutation in human epithelial cells may be some 10-fold higher than in peripheral blood lymphocytes and that the underlying rate of spontaneous mutation is sufficient to account for a large proportion of human carcinogenesis without the need to evoke either stepwise alteration to a mutator phenotype of clonal expansion at all the mutation steps in carcinogenesis. The exponential increase in mutation frequency with age is predictable on the basis that the mutation rate is controlled at the level of repair and that mutation in genes that affect the efficiency of these processes will gradually increase the underlying rate. In addition, the age relatedness of mutation frequency strongly supports the concept that mutation is cell division dependent and that cellular proliferation per se is an important risk factor for cancer. Comparison of somatic mutations with those in the human germline mutation suggests common mechanistic origins and that the high levels of somatic mutation that occur are a direct reflection of the germline mutation rate selected over evolutionary time. Thus, the somatic accumulation of mutations can be seen as a natural process within the human body and cancer a normal part of the human life cycle. This point of view may explain why it has been so difficult to significantly reduce cancer incidence and suggests that, for this to be achieved, the means of altering the natural somatic mutation rate needs to be identified.},

abstract = {Using a 3D co-culture model, we identified significant sub-type-specific changes in gene expression, metabolic, and therapeutic sensitivity profiles of breast cancer cells in contact with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAF-induced gene expression signatures predicted clinical outcome and immune-related differences in the microenvironment. We found that fibroblasts strongly protect carcinoma cells from lapatinib, attributable to its reduced accumulation in carcinoma cells and an elevated apoptotic threshold. Fibroblasts from normal breast tissues and stromal cultures of brain metastases of breast cancer had similar effects as CAFs. Using synthetic lethality approaches, we identified molecular pathways whose inhibition sensitizes HER2+ breast cancer cells to lapatinib both in vitro and in vivo including JAK2/STAT3 and hyaluronic acid. Neoadjuvant lapatinib therapy in HER2+ breast tumors lead to a significant increase of phospho-STAT3+ cancer cells and a decrease in the spatial proximity of proliferating (Ki67+) cells to CAFs impacting therapeutic responses. Our studies identify CAF-induced physiologically and clinically relevant changes in cancer cells and offer novel approaches for overcoming microenvironment-mediated therapeutic resistance.},

abstract = {We propose a modelling framework to analyse the stochastic behaviour of heterogeneous, multi-scale cellular populations. We illustrate our methodology with a particular example in which we study a population with an oxygen-regulated proliferation rate. Our formulation is based on an age-dependent stochastic process. Cells within the population are characterised by their age (i.e. time elapsed since they were born). The age-dependent (oxygen-regulated) birth rate is given by a stochastic model of oxygen-dependent cell cycle progression. Once the birth rate is determined, we formulate an age-dependent birth-and-death process, which dictates the time evolution of the cell population. The population is under a feedback loop which controls its steady state size (carrying capacity): cells consume oxygen which in turn fuels cell proliferation. We show that our stochastic model of cell cycle progression allows for heterogeneity within the cell population induced by stochastic effects. Such heterogeneous behaviour is reflected in variations in the proliferation rate. Within this set-up, we have established three main results. First, we have shown that the age to the G1/S transition, which essentially determines the birth rate, exhibits a remarkably simple scaling behaviour. Besides the fact that this simple behaviour emerges from a rather complex model, this allows for a huge simplification of our numerical methodology. A further result is the observation that heterogeneous populations undergo an internal process of quasi-neutral competition. Finally, we investigated the effects of cell-cycle-phase dependent therapies (such as radiation therapy) on heterogeneous populations. In particular, we have studied the case in which the population contains a quiescent sub-population. Our mean-field analysis and numerical simulations confirm that, if the survival fraction of the therapy is too high, rescue of the quiescent population occurs. This gives rise to emergence of resistance to therapy since the rescued population is less sensitive to therapy.},

Because of this lifestyle similarity, it is predicted that cancer cells could, like numerous parasitic organisms, evolve the capacity to manipulate the phenotype of their hosts to increase their own fitness. We claim that the extent of this phenomenon and its therapeutic implications are, however, underappreciated. Here, we review and discuss what can be regarded as cases of host manipulation in the context of cancer development and progression. We elaborate on how acknowledging the applicability of these principles can offer novel therapeutic and preventive strategies. The manipulation of host phenotype by cancer cells is one more reason to adopt a Darwinian approach in cancer research.},

This theory proposes that cancer is a clonal, cell-based disease, and implicitly assumes that quiescence is the default state of cells in multicellular organisms. The SMT has not been rigorously tested, and several lines of evidence raise questions that are not addressed by this theory. Herein, we propose experimental strategies that may validate the SMT. We also call attention to an alternative theory of carcinogenesis, the tissue organization field theory (TOFT), which posits that cancer is a tissue-based disease and that proliferation is the default state of all cells. Based on epistemological and experimental evidence, we argue that the TOFT compellingly explains carcinogenesis, while placing it within an evolutionarily relevant context.},

(Transl Oncol. 2008;1:158-164) introduced the term ecological therapy for cancer treatment and, in particular, emphasized that destruction of the tumor microenvironment would be more effective than just killing the cells that inhabit it. Proposed here is an expansion on the idea of ecological therapy of cancer, incorporating 1) literature on species invasion, i.e., a right cancerous clone needs to be at the right place at the right time to actually invade its environment, and 2) the literature on niche construction, that is, the idea that once a tumor is formed, cancer cells they modify their microenvironment (niche construction) by changing pH through glycolysis, secreting growth factors and recruiting tumor-associated macrophages to promote cell growth, activating fibroblasts, evading predation from immune system, making the cancer that much more difficult to eradicate. Paleontological literature suggests that the largestmass extinctions occurred when environmental stress that would weaken the population was coupled with some pulse destructive event that caused extensive mortality. To have the same effect on cells in the tumor, rather than, or at least in addition to, killing the cells, one would also need to target the niche that they created for themselves.},

Cancer genome profiling has revealed that specific events are more or less likely to be co-selected, suggesting that the selection of one event depends on the others. However, the nature of these evolutionary dependencies and their impact remain unclear. Here, we designed SELECT, an algorithmic approach to systematically identify evolutionary dependencies from alteration patterns. By analyzing 6,456 genomes from multiple tumor types, we constructed a map of oncogenic dependencies associated with cellular pathways, transcriptional readouts, and therapeutic response.

We studied the relationship between the number of normal stem cell divisions and the risk of 17 cancer types in 69 countries throughout the world. The data revealed a strong correlation (median = 0.80) between cancer incidence and normal stem cell divisions in all countries, regardless of their environment. The major role of R mutations in cancer etiology was supported by an independent approach, based solely on cancer genome sequencing and epidemiological data, which suggested that R mutations are responsible for two-thirds of the mutations in human cancers. All of these results are consistent with epidemiological estimates of the fraction of cancers that can be prevented by changes in the environment. Moreover, they accentuate the importance of early detection and intervention to reduce deaths from the many cancers arising from unavoidable R mutations.},

abstract = {Although tumorigenesis has been accepted as an evolutionary process (20, 102), many forces may operate differently in cancers than in organisms, as they evolve at vastly different time scales. Among such forces, natural selection, here defined as differential cellular proliferation among distinct somatic cell genotypes, is particularly interesting because its action might be thwarted in multicellular organisms (20, 29). In this review, selection is analyzed in two stages of cancer evolution: Stage I is the evolution between tumors and normal tissues, and Stage II is the evolution within tumors. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data show a low degree of convergent evolution in Stage I, where genetic changes are not extensively shared among cases. An equally important, albeit much less highlighted, discovery using TCGA data is that there is almost no net selection in cancer evolution. Both positive and negative selection are evident but they neatly cancel each other out, rendering total selection ineffective ...},

We report here that mice living in an enriched housing environment show reduced tumor growth and increased remission. We found this effect in melanoma and colon cancer models, and that it was not caused by physical activity alone. Serum from animals held in an enriched environment (EE) inhibited cancer proliferation in vitro and was markedly lower in leptin. Hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was selectively upregulated by EE, and its genetic overexpression reduced tumor burden, whereas BDNF knockdown blocked the effect of EE. Mechanistically, we show that hypothalamic BDNF downregulated leptin production in adipocytes via sympathoneural beta-adrenergic signaling. These results suggest that genetic or environmental activation of this BDNF/leptin axis may have therapeutic significance for cancer.},

@article{Meza2008,
abstract = {The observation that the age-specific incidence curve of many carcinomas is approximately linear on a double logarithmic plot has led to much speculation regarding the number and nature of the critical events involved in carcinogenesis. By a consideration of colorectal and pancreatic cancers in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry we show that the log-log model provides a poor description of the data, and that a much better description is provided by a multistage model that predicts two basic phases in the age-specific incidence curves, a first exponential phase until the age of approximately 60 followed by a linear phase after that age. These two phases in the incidence curve reflect two phases in the process of carcinogenesis. Paradoxically, the early-exponential phase reflects events between the formation (initiation) of premalignant clones in a tissue and the clinical detection of a malignant tumor, whereas the linear phase reflects events leading to initiated cells that give rise to premalignant lesions because of abrogated growth/differentiation control. This model is consistent with Knudson's idea that renewal tissue, such as the colon, is converted into growing tissue before malignant transformation. The linear phase of the age-specific incidence curve represents this conversion, which is the result of recessive inactivation of a gatekeeper gene, such as the APC gene in the colon and the CDKN2A gene in the pancreas.},

abstract = {Physical activity is associated with reduced risk of several cancers, including aggressive prostate cancer. The mechanisms mediating the effects are not yet understood; among the candidates are modifications of endogenous hormone levels. Long-term exercise is known to reduce serum levels of growth stimulating hormones. In contrast, the endocrine effects of acute endurance exercise include increased levels of mitogenic factors such as GH and IGF-1. It can be speculated that the elevation of serum growth factors may be detrimental to prostate cancer progression into malignancy. The incentive of the current study is to evaluate the effect of acute exercise serum on prostate cancer cell growth. We designed an exercise intervention where 10 male individuals performed 60 minutes of bicycle exercise at increasing intensity. Serum samples were obtained before (rest serum) and after completed exercise (exercise serum). The established prostate cancer cell line LNCaP was exposed to exercise or rest serum. Exercise serum from 9 out of 10 individuals had a growth inhibitory effect on LNCaP cells. Incubation with pooled exercise serum resulted in a 31{\%} inhibition of LNCaP growth and pre-incubation before subcutaneous injection into SCID mice caused a delay in tumor formation. Serum analyses indicated two possible candidates for the effect; increased levels of IGFBP-1 and reduced levels of EGF. In conclusion, despite the fear of possible detrimental effects of acute exercise serum on tumor cell growth, we show that even the short-term effects seem to add to the overall beneficial influence of exercise on neoplasia.},

abstract = {Cancers are distributed unevenly across the body, but??the importance of cell intrinsic factors such as stem cell function in determining organ cancer risk is unknown. Therefore, we used Cre-recombination of conditional lineage tracing, oncogene, and tumor suppressor alleles to define populations of stem and non-stem cells in mouse organs and test their life-long susceptibility to tumorigenesis. We show that tumor incidence is determined by the life-long generative capacity of mutated cells. This relationship held true in the presence of multiple genotypes and regardless of developmental stage, strongly supporting the notion that stem cells dictate organ cancer risk. Using the liver as a model system, we further show that damage-induced activation of stem cell function markedly increases cancer risk. Therefore, we propose that a combination of stem cell mutagenesis and extrinsic factors that enhance the proliferation of these cell populations, creates a ???perfect storm??? that ultimately determines organ cancer risk.

abstract = {New applications of evolutionary biology are transforming our understanding of cancer. The articles in this special issue provide many specific examples, such as microorganisms inducing cancers, the significance of within-tumor heterogeneity, and the possibility that lower dose chemotherapy may sometimes promote longer survival. Underlying these specific advances is a large-scale transformation, as cancer research incorporates evolutionary methods into its toolkit, and asks new evolutionary questions about why we are vulnerable to cancer. Evolution explains why cancer exists at all, how neoplasms grow, why cancer is remarkably rare, and why it occurs despite powerful cancer suppression mechanisms. Cancer exists because of somatic selection; mutations in somatic cells result in some dividing faster than others, in some cases generating neoplasms. Neoplasms grow, or do not, in complex cellular ecosystems. Cancer is relatively rare because of natural selection; our genomes were derived disproportionally from individuals with effective mechanisms for suppressing cancer. Cancer occurs nonetheless for the same six evolutionary reasons that explain why we remain vulnerable to other diseases. These four principles-cancers evolve by somatic selection, neoplasms grow in complex ecosystems, natural selection has shaped powerful cancer defenses, and the limitations of those defenses have evolutionary explanations-provide a foundation for understanding, preventing, and treating cancer.},

abstract = {Metastasis involves the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to surrounding tissues and to distant organs and is the primary cause of cancer morbidity and mortality. In order to complete the metastatic cascade, cancer cells must detach from the primary tumor, intravasate into the circulatory and lymphatic systems, evade immune attack, extravasate at distant capillary beds, and invade and proliferate in distant organs. Currently, several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the origin of cancer metastasis. These involve an epithelial mesenchymal transition, an accumulation of mutations in stem cells, a macrophage facilitation process, and a macrophage origin involving either transformation or fusion hybridization with neoplastic cells. Many of the properties of metastatic cancer cells are also seen in normal macrophages. A macrophage origin of metastasis can also explain the long-standing "seed and soil" hypothesis and the absence of metastasis in plant cancers. The view of metastasis as a macrophage metabolic disease can provide novel insight for therapeutic management.},

abstract = {Multicellularity is characterized by cooperation among cells for the development, maintenance and reproduction of the multicellular organism. Cancer can be viewed as cheating within this cooperative multicellular system. Complex multicellularity, and the cooperation underlying it, has evolved independently multiple times. We review the existing literature on cancer and cancer-like phenomena across life, not only focusing on complex multicellularity but also reviewing cancer-like phenomena across the tree of life more broadly. We find that cancer is characterized by a breakdown of the central features of cooperation that characterize multicellularity, including cheating in proliferation inhibition, cell death, division of labour, resource allocation and extracellular environment maintenance (which we term the five foundations of multicellularity). Cheating on division of labour, exhibited by a lack of differentiation and disorganized cell masses, has been observed in all forms of multicellularity. This suggests that deregulation of differentiation is a fundamental and universal aspect of carcinogenesis that may be underappreciated in cancer biology. Understanding cancer as a breakdown of multicellular cooperation provides novel insights into cancer hallmarks and suggests a set of assays and biomarkers that can be applied across species and characterize the fundamental requirements for generating a cancer.},

abstract = {Subclonal cancer populations change spatially and temporally during the disease course. Studies are revealing branched evolutionary cancer growth with low-frequency driver events present in subpopulations of cells, providing escape mechanisms for targeted therapeutic approaches. Despite such complexity, evidence is emerging for parallel evolution of subclones, mediated through distinct somatic events converging on the same gene, signal transduction pathway, or protein complex in different subclones within the same tumor. tumors may follow both gradualist paths (microevolution) and major shifts in evolutionary trajectories (macroevolution). Although macroevolution has been subject to considerable controversy in post-Darwinian evolutionary theory, here we review evidence that such nongradual, saltatory leaps, driven by chromosomal rearrangements or genome doubling, may be particularly relevant to tumor evolution. Adapting cancer care to the challenges imposed by tumor micro- and macroevolution and developing deeper insight into parallel evolutionary events may prove central to improving outcome and reducing drug development costs.

abstract = {Mitochondria are the cells' powerhouse, but also their suicidal weapon store. Dozens of lethal signal transduction pathways converge on mitochondria to cause the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, leading to the cytosolic release of pro-apoptotic proteins and to the impairment of the bioenergetic functions of mitochondria. The mitochondrial metabolism of cancer cells is deregulated owing to the use of glycolytic intermediates, which are normally destined for oxidative phosphorylation, in anabolic reactions. Activation of the cell death machinery in cancer cells by inhibiting tumour-specific alterations of the mitochondrial metabolism or by stimulating mitochondrial membrane permeabilization could therefore be promising therapeutic approaches.},

Assemblages of ostensibly normal tissue and bone marrow-derived (stromal) cells are recruited to constitute tumorigenic microenvironments. Most of the hallmarks of cancer are enabled and sustained to varying degrees through contributions from repertoires of stromal cell types and distinctive subcell types. Their contributory functions to hallmark capabilities are increasingly well understood, as are the reciprocal communications with neoplastic cancer cells that mediate their recruitment, activation, programming, and persistence.

abstract = {Ten years ago, Hanahan and Weinberg delineated six "Hallmarks of cancer" which summarize several decades of intense cancer research. However, tumor cells do not act in isolation, but rather subsist in a rich microenvironment provided by resident fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes, leukocytes, and extra-cellular matrix. It is increasingly appreciated that the tumor stroma is an integral part of cancer initiation, growth and progression. The stromal elements of tumors hold prognostic, as well as response-predictive, information, and abundant targeting opportunities within the tumor microenvironment are continually identified. Herein we review the current understanding of tumor cell interactions with the tumor stroma with a particular focus on cancer-associated fibroblasts and pericytes. Moreover, we discuss emerging fields of research which need to be further explored in order to fulfil the promise of stroma-targeted therapies for cancer. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

Multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology beyond bioenergetics support transformation, including mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover, fission and fusion dynamics, cell death susceptibility, oxidative stress regulation, metabolism, and signaling.

Here we show that as little as 5{\%} tumorigenic cells will actively mediate coalescence between primary aggregates of majority non-tumorigenic or non-cancerous cells, by forming cellular cables between them.

abstract = {Owing to recent advances in genomic technologies, personalized oncology is poised to fundamentally alter cancer therapy. In this paradigm, the mutational and transcriptional profiles of tumors are assessed, and personalized treatments are designed based on the specific molecular abnormalities relevant to each patient's cancer. To date, such approaches have yielded impressive clinical responses in some patients. However, a major limitation of this strategy has also been revealed: the vast majority of tumor mutations are not targetable by current pharmacological approaches. Immunotherapy offers a promising alternative to exploit tumor mutations as targets for clinical intervention. Mutated proteins can give rise to novel antigens (called neoantigens) that are recognized with high specificity by patient T cells. Indeed, neoantigen-specific T cells have been shown to underlie clinical responses to many standard treatments and immunotherapeutic interventions. Moreover, studies in mouse models targeting neoantigens, and early results from clinical trials, have established proof of concept for personalized immunotherapies targeting next-generation sequencing identified neoantigens. Here, we review basic immunological principles related to T-cell recognition of neoantigens, and we examine recent studies that use genomic data to design personalized immunotherapies. We discuss the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead on the road to improving patient outcomes by incorporating immunotherapy into the paradigm of personalized oncology.},
