## Records of experiments pertaining to evolutionary dynamics in cancer @ IISER Pune

As of 3 May, 2018, the primary aim of the line of work contained in this repository is to study context dependence in outcomes of somatic cellular competition; while mutants are widely observed in tumour populations, whether their selective advantage relative to non-mutants is permanent remains to be explored systematically. We propose that this selective advantage in combination with competing cellular phenotypes and the environment that mediates this competition. For example, growth factor (GF)-independent growth is likely to be advantageous only under conditions of GF depletion, as sufficient GF levels allow for growth of competing GF-dependent cells as well.

There is sure to be more nuance than suggested by this simplistic example, and that is the subject of exploration in this line of work.
